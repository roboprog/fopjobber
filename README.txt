FopJobber:

An alternative to XSLT to generate Formatting Objects XML output,
using programming (Groovy and/or Java) to process the input data.

Is this for you?
Not if you love XSLT, and have small runs.

Perhaps if you want something that allows you to do conventional debugging,
or that runs larger batches in chunks,
of that doesn't have XML input.
